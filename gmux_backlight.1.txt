=================
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
gmux_backlight - Modify brightness of displays attached to a gmux.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*gmux_backlight* +50

*gmux_backlight* -50

*gmux_backlight* 50

DESCRIPTION
-----------

gmux_backlight reads from and writes
`/sys/class/backlight/gmux_backlight/brightness` to control the brightness of
your gmux-attached display.

This is useful on laptops with two graphics cards where the internal display
is attached to a hardware multiplexer (gmux).

The paramter is an integer, optionally prefixed with `+` or `-`.

* `+` increases the brightness value by the given integer.

* `-` decreases the brightness value by the given integer.

* Without a prefix, the brightness value is set to the given value.

NOTES
-----
The software is installed with setuid and setgid enabled since only root can
modify the sysfs entry but usually changing display brightness is an action
taken by a non-privileged user.
